This is the repository where I start tracking my learning.

Like all people, I have a problem with procrastination, but I have big knowledge desires. That is Why I want to write what I'm interested in and what I do each day. 

Languages:

All products that I will create will be put on git. Rules I will define later, but it is based on 100codechallenage.
